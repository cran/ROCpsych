Description: Functions for (1) computing diagnostic test statistics (sensitivity, specificity, etc.) from confusion matrices with adjustment for various base rates or known prevalence based on McCaffrey et al (2003) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-0079-7_1>, (2) computing optimal cut-off scores with different criteria including maximizing sensitivity, maximizing specificity, and maximizing the Youden Index from Youden (1950) <https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-0142%281950%293%3A1%3C32%3A%3AAID-CNCR2820030106%3E3.0.CO%3B2-3>, and (3) displaying and comparing classification statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves or area under the curves (AUC) across consecutive categories for ordinal variables.
